    "# Theoretical Background of Direction of Arrival (DoA) Methods for ULA\n",

    "This document provides the fundamental theoretical derivations for common Direction of Arrival (DoA) methods used with Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA).\n",
    "Understanding these concepts will deepen your comprehension of how radar systems estimate the angles of incoming signals.\n",
    "We'll cover Delay-and-Sum Beamforming (DSBF), its relationship to FFT Beamforming (FFT-BF), and the high-resolution MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) algorithm.\n",

    "First, we define a right-handed coordinate system as follows: The $x$-axis points to the right, the $y$-axis points upward, and the positive direction of the azimuth angle is counterclockwise around the $z$-axis.\n",
    "Next, we consider a uniform linear array (ULA) with $N$ elements placed along the x-axis, with a uniform inter-element spacing of $d$.\n",
    "The element numbers increase in the positive $x$-axis direction. Here, $d$ is given as a fraction of the wavelength; for example, $d = 0.5$.\n",
